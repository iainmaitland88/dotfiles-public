# Quick start

Symlink config files to `.config` like

```bash
mkdir ~/.config/nvim
ln -s /Users/iain.maitland/Code/iainmaitland88/dotfiles-public/.config/nvim/init.lua ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
```

⚠️ Don't symlink directories or we can end up with extra files in here which make for annoying git statuses.

I'm not using every dotfile or config in this repo. Some are left over from apps I no longer use but kept in case I go back to them.
